file impossible_password to check the type, that is ELF 64 bit, but stripped. Therefore debug symbols not present
Executing, we can see that it requires password.
use strings to get first password.
using that password we need another input, which changes accroding to timeand generates random function and thus can exploit that.
Another way is that we know the flag would be static and thus we can generate the flag from the function.
We use ghidra to get the falg function and we can see the main pointer passes encrypted flag pointer to the function.
The encryption is nothing but char xor 9
Traverse throught the array and we can find the flag.:
