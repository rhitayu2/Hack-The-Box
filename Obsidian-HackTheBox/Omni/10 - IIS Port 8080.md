# IIS Server Port 8080

## Basic Information
- Port 8080 asks for authentication upon visiting
- The title of the page says : Windows Device Portal
- Tried Default credentials for IoT --> Administrator:p@ssw0rd , didn't work. But now it is known that it lets you configure devices remotely
- Running gobuster against the webpage wouldn't give us results as it would ask for authentication.
